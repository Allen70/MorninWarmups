SHORTCUT LIST

note: 
  My keyboard says alt, but for alot of people the alt key will be the option key, specifically if you have a mac laptop. 

Deleting Shortcuts (Mac):
- 'alt + backspace' to delete a word at a time
- 'cmd + bckspc' to delete a whole line
- 'fn + backspace' to delete forwards
- 'fn + backspace + alt' to delete word forwards
- 'fn + backspace + cmd' to delete line forwards

Move the cursor around Shortcuts:
- 'alt + ->' move right a whole word
- 'cmd + ->' move to end of line
- 'cmd + upArrow' move to top of page

Move Lines up and down
- 'alt + up' moves line up
- 'alt + down' moves line down
- 'alt + shift + (up or down)' copies the line up, or copies the line down
  
Open Terminal
- 'cntrl + ` '
notice what happens to your active cursor when you do this, hint hint it s
